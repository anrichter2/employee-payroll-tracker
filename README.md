# employee-payroll-tracker

## Description

For this project I was hired by a payroll manager to create a payroll tracking application. The manager wanted the application to ask for employee information including first and last name as well as their salary, and then display the information in a table sorted by last name. On top of that the manager also wanted the application to log the number of employees and the average salary. Lastly the manager also wanted the application to select a random employee as a random drawing winner.
